Pling!
================================================================================
__Pling!__ is a native 8-bit [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))-like scripting language, under development, for 8-bit micro-computers; first for the Commodore 64 with plans for the Commander X16 later.

The term "Pling" is another name for an exclamantion mark, apparently coined by [Acorn Computers Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers) as the term is used often in regards to [RISC OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC_OS).

Forth was invented on a 16-bit mini-computer, and whilst there are many ports of FORTH to 8-bit systems -- [DurexForth](https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth) is an excellent C64 implementation -- the implicitly 16-bit nature of Forth  means that 8-bit micro-computers end up doing more work than is necessary for most of the time.
