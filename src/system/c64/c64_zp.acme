; "zp.acme" : Pling zero-page layout for C64
;===============================================================================

; Pling's data stack works downwards from $FF to $C0 (64 bytes)
; TODO: may have to move due to KERNAL zp-usage?
;
!addr   pl_stack        = $ff
!addr   pl_type         = $bf

; $00/$01 are not available on the C64 as these are the CPU port
; (see "c64/system/c64.acme")
;
; base address of Pling's private zp-space:
+alloc  $02
+addr   ~pl_zp

; address of the last defined term
; (updated when new terms are added)
+word   ~pl_last
; the address of the next free byte of memory
+word   ~pl_here
